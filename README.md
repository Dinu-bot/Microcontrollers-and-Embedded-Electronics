## PIC16F628A Microcontroller Experiments 🛠️

Welcome to the PIC16F628A Microcontroller Experiments repository! This project contains a collection of experiments, reports, and additional exercises developed using the PIC16F628A microcontroller. Each experiment includes well-documented code, relevant screenshots, and detailed explanations to facilitate learning and implementation. The tools used in this project are Proteus 8 Professional, MPLAB IPE v3.00, and mikroC PRO for PIC.


## 🛠️ Tools Used

The following tools were used to develop and simulate the experiments:

- Proteus 8 Professional 🖥️: For circuit design and simulation.
- MPLAB IPE v3.00 ⚙️: For programming and configuring the PIC16F628A microcontroller.
- mikroC PRO for PIC 💻: For writing, compiling, and debugging C code for the PIC microcontroller.
